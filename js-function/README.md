# Function
* Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. 
* A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. 

#### Function declarations
->A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

  * The name of the function.
  * A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
  * The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { /* … */ }.
  
-> We  can pass Object or Array as parameter of function.
   * When you pass an object as a parameter, if the function changes the object's properties, that change is visible outside the function.
   * When you pass an array as a parameter, if the function changes any of the array's values, that change is visible outside the function.
